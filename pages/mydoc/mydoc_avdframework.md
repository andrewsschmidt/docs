## Design Process

This is the stage of the process where we collect end-user requirements and determine if they can be integrated into one of our general POC/Pilot models for testing and data collection for users requirements.

## Discovery items for conceptual design process:

- Operating System Version
- Application Installed Outside the Presented Defaults
- Internet Access requirements outside corp standard zscaler
- Internal Resource Access Requirements, From Azure to AJG Datacenter Hosted
- Conceptual Capacity Planning - Size Recommendations

## POC / Pilot

If we have a pre-existing image that meets the requirements, we can provide a temporary desktop for proof-of-concept purposes. If the project necessitates a pilot, we can also provide a pilot configuration.

- Mock up build
- Test Drive
- Capacity Analysis Requirements

## Deployment Plan

After developing the business case and proving the conceptual production solution, it is now time to plan the deployment. This is when a project manager may become involved and gather the following requirements:

- Stakeholders
- Prerequisites Defined
- Infrastructure Work Orders Created
- Risk Defined
- Deployment Timelines
- Resource to manage tasks and expectations
